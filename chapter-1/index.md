Welcome to Chapter 1 of _{{ site.title }}_. In this chapter, we will embark on our journey to learn the fundamentals of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by setting up the project structure for a web application and creating a simple "Hello World" API.

A well-organized project structure is crucial for the maintainability and scalability of any web application. A clean and logical project layout not only makes it easier to navigate through the codebase, but also fosters good development practices and efficient collaboration.

Throughout this chapter, we'll walk you through the following essential steps:

1. Setting up the development environment, including the necessary tools and dependencies.
2. Creating a project structure that supports efficient development, testing, and deployment.
3. Building a simple "Hello World" API using FastAPI.
4. Writing and running tests to ensure the API behaves as expected.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to set up a web application project using TDD principles, and you'll be ready to tackle more advanced topics in the following chapters.

So, let's get started on this exciting adventure and dive into the world of project setup, API creation, and testing!
